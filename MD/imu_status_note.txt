IMU Status Note (saved for next terminal session)
Date: 2026-02-10
Workspace: /home/ubuntu/rover_ws

Current symptom
- imu_bridge_node starts, but prints:
  "No IMU message received yet from /ros_robot_controller/imu_raw"

Confirmed root cause
- Upstream producer (ros_robot_controller) is not receiving IMU telemetry from STM32 over /dev/rrc.
- Therefore /ros_robot_controller/imu_raw stays empty.

Direct evidence
- Log file:
  /home/ubuntu/.ros/log/python3_26941_1770730892382.log
- Repeated warning in that log:
  "no IMU telemetry on /dev/rrc @ 1000000 (topic /ros_robot_controller/imu_raw will stay empty)"

What is NOT the root cause
- imu_bridge_cpp node logic itself is not the direct cause.
- Depth camera (Orbbec DaBai DCW) is separate and was running normally.

Fast recovery order
1) Restart ros_robot_controller only:
   ros2 launch ros_robot_controller ros_robot_controller.launch.py
2) Check raw IMU:
   ros2 topic echo /ros_robot_controller/imu_raw --once
3) If still empty: power-cycle STM32 board and replug USB (/dev/rrc).
4) Re-run ros_robot_controller and check /ros_robot_controller/imu_raw again.
5) Then start bridge:
   ros2 run imu_bridge_cpp imu_bridge_node --ros-args -p input_topic:=/ros_robot_controller/imu_raw -p output_topic:=/imu/data -p frame_id:=imu_link

If issue keeps recurring
- Treat as serial/firmware telemetry stability issue in STM32->ros_robot_controller path.
- Add watchdog + auto-restart policy for ros_robot_controller.
